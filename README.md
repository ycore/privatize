## Installation

To install `privatize.js`, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

## Usage

To use `privatize`, you need to create a `privatize.json` file in your application root directory. This file should contain the packages you want to install. Hereâ€™s an example of how to structure the file:

```json
{
  "packages": ["your-private-package-1", "your-private-package-2"]
}
```

### Running privatize.js

After setting up your `privatize.json`, you can run the `privatize.js` script. Make sure you have your SSH keys set up and the `DEPLOYMENT_KEY` environment variable configured.

You can run the script using Node.js:

```bash
node node_modules/privatize/index.js
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- **DEPLOYMENT_KEY**: This environment variable should contain the base64-encoded private SSH key used for authentication with GitHub. You can set it in your terminal like this:

```bash
export DEPLOYMENT_KEY="base64_encoded_private_key"
```

### privatize.json
