# Creating a Minimal npm Package for GitHub

To create a minimal package that can be hosted on GitHub (like `http://github.com/ycore/privatize`) and installed via npm, follow these basic steps:

## 1. Create a New Directory

Create a new directory for your package and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir privatize
cd privatize
```

## 2. Initialize a New npm Package and git repository

Run the following command to create a `package.json` file and `.git` folder:

```bash
npm init -y
git init
```

This command will generate a `package.json` file with default values. Edit this file to add more details.

## 3. Create Main and REDME Files

Create `index.js` JavaScript file that will serve as the entry point for your package. README.md contains the package instructions:

```bash
touch index.js
touch README.md
echo "node_modules/\nnpm-debug.log\n" > .gitignore
```

In `index.js`, you can add some basic functionality. For example:

```javascript
// index.js
module.exports = function () {
  console.log('privatize package is working!');
};
```

## 4. Update package.json

Edit the `package.json` file to specify the entry point and other relevant information. Hereâ€™s an example of what it might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "privatize",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A minimal package for privatize functionality",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/ycore/privatize.git"
  },
  "keywords": ["privatize", "npm"],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

## 5. Push to GitHub

Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `ycore/privatize`) and push your local repository to GitHub:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ycore/privatize.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 9. Optionally publish to npm

If you want to publish your package to npm, you need to create an account on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/). After that, you can publish your package:

```bash
npm login
npm publish
```
